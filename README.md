Part 1: From scratch, create a program to…
- Declare an array to hold 10 test scores
- Read in 10 Exam scores from the user. Only allow valid scores (0-100, inclusive) to be stored in the
array. If an invalid score is entered, display an error message and re-read that value as many times as
needed to validate.
- Once user input is complete, display the high score, the low score, and the class average (to decimal
places), each on a separate line.
Reminder: Do NOT include ‘bad data’ (ex: a negative exam score, over 100, etc.) as part of your data.
(Here is some test data to try: 87, 98, 87, 56, 78, 67, 99, 92, 93, 87 … Avg is 84.40)
Once you get Part 1 working properly, demo for a UTA or the instructor before continuing on to Part 2
